// submit an entry for the daily leaderboard
// generate consistent daily challenges (seed by date)
// prevent duplicate entries (by user by date)

// get the overall leaderboard
// submit an entry for the overall leaderboard

// validate the json (zod) & put in safegards for the payload size
// prevent duplicate entries
